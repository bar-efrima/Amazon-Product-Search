# Amazon-Product-Search
Welcome to my Amazon scraping project. 
FastAPI web app that displays item prices from multiple Amazon websites.

-Users can search for items
-view scraped results
-see prices from different Amazon sites.

It includes features like currency conversion, search limits, and past search history
To run the project, please execute the following command: "uvicorn --Server:app --reload" and the page will open

I have attached a video to demonstrate how the website works.
Please note that the website has a restriction of 10 searches per user.
After 10 searches, the user will be blocked.
